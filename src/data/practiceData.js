      for an interesting final look.`

      `A React-Redux based Dungeon Crawler game with a leaning toward using immutible data structures and pure functions.`,

      gain more experience with functional programming standards.`,
      `It has since become something of a pet project that I add features to and re-factor when the mood strikes. As such
      it now sports a separate level builder.`
